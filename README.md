VISION

Minecraft servers have a lot of problems. On minecraft you cheat, bugabuse and insult.
Server now use anticheats and moderators that help the server being moderated.
Server anticheats usually dont find blatant cheats because they can be bypassed.
If a person cheat and no staff is online you cant do anything if the hacker can bypass anticheat.

How to solve this problem?
People want a clean server and have benefits reporting.
Users will be able to jail, mute and deop people without staff support.
The vision that I have is that this method could completly sobstitute staffers and that instead of jailing in the next future people could instantly ban.

For the moment the jailed people can be controlled by the staffer.

Costum reports
Each server can create its own GUI where there will be different categories of report.
When people report they can choose vote intensity (the higher the vote, the higher the rewards or slashes will be)
If a person is uncertain of the reported player he can simply signal with less intensity.

Player vote
User will vote based on server rules and punishments will be given automatically.
The plugin can't substitute completly moderators so when a player will be reported, she/he won't be directly banned but only freezed and tped to a safe place "Controlling zone" where he cannot do damage.
In that moment staff can procede and check the player.

Voting power and rewards
Voting power will start set at 1000 (same as ELO system).
When a player reports other player his vote intensity will determine the amount of voting power possible to win or lose. (Voting power isn't commerciable)
The intensity is a percentage and it will go from 0 to 50.

To assure the report is genuine the player will lock a percentage of points equal to the percentage of Voting power that she he can lose or win. The points locked are only a warranty. This will assure no random reports to be made.

You win from 0 a 50% of your voting power. Points locked will be given back.
You lose from 0 a 50% of your voting power. Points locked will be lost.

No points given away.
Staff will recieve special staff points based on activity (equallity if they check a report and player is legit or not).
Staffers will not be able to ban players if they didnt recieve a certain amount of reports choose from staff.
Admins and owners will be able to value staff points as they like.

Specific rules if you apply screenshares
If a jailed person in a certain amount of time doesnt communicate with the staff will be banned automatically
You can't report a player more than one time but you can report for multiple reasons.
When player you reported quits the server you get back your points.
